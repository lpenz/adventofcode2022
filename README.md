# adventofcode2022

Code for the 2022 puzzles at https://adventofcode.com/2022/


## Noteworthy days (spoiler alert!)

Some interesting things that happened on specific days:

- Day 17: Tetris! This was by far the hardest for me.
- Day 21: part 2 is about inverting operations in an expression tree
  to find the value of a variable that is deep in a branch.
- Day 22: part 2 pastes the grid sides on a "dice".
- Day 25: balanced base 5.
